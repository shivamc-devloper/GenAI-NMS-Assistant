# GenAI NMS Assistant - Frontend (Vite + React)

This is a minimal frontend scaffold implementing the requested UI sections: Device Header, Metrics, Interfaces Table, and Diagnostics with CSS-only animations.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "D:\Bitvivid\GenAI Assistant NMS(Prototype)\Git Hub\GenAI-NMS-Assistant\frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes:
- This is a simple scaffold for UI prototyping. Hook the components to your backend endpoints in `src/components` as needed.
- Animations and visuals are implemented in `src/styles.css`.
